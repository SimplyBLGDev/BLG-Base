## FOR NON PROGRAMMING DEVELOPERS AND ASSET MAKERS
On the root of the repository there's a _.concept_ folder, this folder is not read nor compiled by godot and should be used to contain any assets that need versioning/sharing with the team but don't need to be included in the godot project, such as:
- Photoshop files
- Text files for organization, TODO Lists etc.
- In progress assets

> Please keep filenames descriptive and the folder structure clean.
