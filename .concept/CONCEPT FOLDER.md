## FOR NON PROGRAMMING DEVELOPERS AND ASSET MAKERS
On the root of the repository there's a folder .concept, this folder is not read by godot and should be used to contain any asset that needs versioning/sharing with the team but doesn't straight up go into the godot project such as:
- Photoshop files
- Text files for organization, TODO Lists etc.
- In progress assets
Please keep filenames descriptive and the folder structure clean
